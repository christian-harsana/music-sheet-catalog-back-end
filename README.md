# Music Sheet Catalog (Back End)
An app for organising music sheet collections, where users can search for pieces and access information such as the books they belong to, their level of difficulty, and their genre.

## Problem
My wife is a piano teacher with a large collection of music sheets. As her collection grows, she often spends a lot of time trying to find the right pieces for different students. Quite often, she can’t remember which books contain the specific sheets she needs.

## Solution
This app allows her to catalog and manage her growing collection of music sheets in an organised way. It enables searching by title, level of difficulty, or genre, making it quick and easy to locate specific pieces. By providing details about which book each piece belongs to, the app helps save time and reduces the frustration of manually searching through stacks of books.
