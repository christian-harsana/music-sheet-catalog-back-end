# Music Sheet Catalog (Back End)
An API-based web application designed for piano teachers to organize their sheet music collections and help them quickly find suitable pieces when creating lesson plans. Features include the ability to search for pieces by book/collection, composer, musical key, difficulty level, genre, or association with examination pieces.

## Problem
My wife is a piano teacher with a large sheet music collection. As the collection grows, she begins to lose track of what she has and often spends a lot of time searching for the right pieces for her students. She frequently can’t remember which books or collections contain the specific sheets she needs.

## Solution
This app allows her to catalog and manage her growing sheet music collection in an organised way. It enables searching by title, composer, musical key, difficulty level, genre, or association with exam pieces, making it quick and easy to locate specific works. By showing which book or collection each piece belongs to, the app saves time and reduces the frustration of manually searching through stacks of books.
